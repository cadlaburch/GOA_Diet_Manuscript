#WHAT IS MY MODEL PURPOSE????????

#'Assess variation in GOA food web structure and groundfish diets in relation to temperature using network analysis
#'and statistical modeling.
#'Analyze shifts in food web structure and energy flow in response to altered temperature regimes.

#DEFINE THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES AND RESPONSE VARIABLES
#Independent: Temperature, Year, Region, Depth?
#Response: Network Structure (choose a metric from network analysis)

#WRITE MODEL EQUATION
#'We will identify key prey nodes and model variation in the contribution (PW, Occurance) of those key prey to select 
#'predator diets as a function of sampling date, geographic location, depth, and temperature at trawl depth

#-----------------------
#QUESTION 1:
#Which Predators should I include?

#This chunk calculates the number of predator stomachs of each species sampled for each year

#DECISION:
#I am only going to build networks using only Walleye Pollock, Arrowtooth Flounder, Pacific Cod, Pacific Halibut

#Sablefish were only sampled up to 2011

#DECISION
#1981 and 1987 are consistently missing data across focal predators. I'm going to exclude those years from analysis
#POP are sampled through the heatwave period but sablefish are not. I'll table them for now and focus on the main 4 preds.

#How should I break up the data geographically?

#'Aleutian islands data: on the N side of the chain, all hauls at bottom depths of 550m or less get assigned to AI
#'On the south side of the chain, all hauls (regardless of depth) westward of 170 W longitude get assigned to AI. INPFC (541, 542, 543)

#DECISION
#'for now I'm going to ignore this question, but I think that I need to think about it more. For example if one model
#'is mostly large sizes in 2011, but then the next year is mostly small sizes we may see a difference in the networks
#'that is due to ontogeny that we might accidentally attribute to temperature
#'Similarly if one year we have a large sample size and the next a small



#---------------------------
#Question 6:
#What metrics should I pull from the networks to use for GAMS?
#In-Degree, Out-Degree, Degree Centrality
#Clustering Coefficient
#Network diameter
#Average path length
#Weighted Edges: Node strength, closeness, betweeness, clustering coeff redefined by using a triplet value WGCNA R Package?


#----------------------------
#Question 7:
#Should I be modeling predators and prey of the same species as one node?
unique(network_sc_filtered$Pred_Species)
#The Pred_Species matches the Prey_name_clean in the groupings doc
#The Pred_Common matches the Prey_Name in the original document

#Decision: Yes I should be modeling predators and prey as the same node for the big 4 species.

#-----------------------------
#Question 8:
#How should I weight the edges in the network.
#Percent frequency of occurrence, Percent Weight of prey


#-----------------------------
#Question 9:
#Should I include empty stomachs?

#Output Files
#These files are the outputs from my decisions about what to model. I will use these files to generate the networks
#in a different R script.
